## Challenges

* The hardest part of this application was figuring out how to get the necessary user information properly passed through to the sql code

* Recalling information learned for the first time a couple lessons ago and building off of it

* Creating a Command Line Application when all previous MySQL practice was through a Front End Application

## Future Improvements

* Finish bonus point additions to this project (Update employee managers, view employees by manager, view employees by department, delete departments, roles, and employees, and view total utilized budget of a department)
